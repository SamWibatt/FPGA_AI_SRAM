# FPGA_AI_SRAM
Preliminary part of AI acceleration with FPGAs, interfacing external memory for greater capacity.

# Objective

The initial goal is to try accelerating some data structures such as red/black trees and running some old AI techniques like A* to get a feel for how well programmable logic can tighten them up.

Ultimately, I want to implement modern methods such as RNNs, but since I'm still working on tiny cheap eval boards it's unlikely I can do much - but I will look into it, and I will learn some useful things in this endeavor that will transfer (transfer learning LOL) I imagine I'm also going to have to pick up DSP for best results there.

# Notes

I will be keeping my usual stream of consciousness notes in the repo wiki, qv.
